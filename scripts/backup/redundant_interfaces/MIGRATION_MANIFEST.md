# OBIX Framework Abstract Interface Migration Manifest

## Migration Objective
Eliminate abstract base classes and metadata inheritance patterns to support
single-pass concrete implementation architecture for optimal automaton 
state minimization performance.

## Migration Categories

### Base Classes (Base*.ts)
Files following the Base*.ts naming pattern that introduce abstract inheritance.

### Abstract Interfaces  
TypeScript interfaces with inheritance chains that create metadata overhead.

### Metadata Inheritance
Classes utilizing abstract inheritance patterns contrary to concrete implementation requirements.

## Architectural Rationale
Single-pass concrete implementations eliminate:
- Metadata inheritance overhead
- Abstract class resolution complexity  
- Interface mismatch potential
- State machine optimization barriers

## Post-Migration Verification
All remaining implementations should be concrete classes with direct instantiation
capability supporting the OBIX automaton state minimization architecture.
